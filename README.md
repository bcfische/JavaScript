UFO Sightings

Here, we create a basic HTML web page and use the provided UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects to write code
that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. There are columns for date/time, city, state,
country, shape, and comments. We use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that listens for events and searches
through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
